# to-do-list-using-java-script.
Here to-do list source code is available using js here all the images are global to all no need to change the src of the images and I have defined some of the variables of my own if you wish you can change them as per your convenience. And in the js code I have given some dummy to-dos from Jason's placeholder in order of API servers i you want to add your own to-dos simply comment on the fetch function in the js code. I hope it helps.
